# AI_Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm for maximizing three dimension functions.
## How to Use
In the GeneticAlgorithm.py file, change the desired function to the function you want to maximize.
### Configurations
It's possible to change the values for the mutation rate(0-1), size of the population and Cross Over rate(0-100). Just change the values in the beginning of the code.
## Method
- Population Initialization: Random.
- Selection: Roulette Wheel.
- Cross Over: Arithmetic.
- Mutation: Random.
## Output
The file creates a graphic that shows the convergence of the population to the maximum value and print the most adaptated individuum
